See the head of indent/inform.vim for notes and TODO

This is a beta. Please send bug-reports, comments, patches, etc. to 
	vim@zugzwang.port5.com

INSTALLATION:

	See :help plugin, but here's a quick walkthrough:

	Put ./indent/inform.vim in your indent directory - on unix, that's 
	~/.vim/indent/ - you might need to mkdir it first.
	
	Do similarly with ./ftplugin/inform.vim - that should go in ~/.vim/ftplugin/

	You'll need to make sure this line (or equivalent) is in your ~/.vimrc:
		set filetype indent plugin on

	The indenting works much better if you're using syntax highlighting -
	you might want to put
		syntax on
	in your ~/.vimrc

	You might have problems with Vim thinking your .h includes are C files -
	see http://www.stephenthomas.uklinux.net/informvim for a solution.
